# Git Browse

For using git in a more screen reader friendly way and for those who like to go one at a time

Run `gh auth login` and approve the app in the browser. 

## Installation

Download and copy the [latest release](https://github.com/hbk619/git-browse/releases/download/v0.0.2/git-pr) to somewhere on your path (e.g. `/usr/local/bin`)

## Usage

`git pr <pr number>`

## Developing
